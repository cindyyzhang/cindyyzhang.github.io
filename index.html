            <p>Hello! I'm a Computer Science PhD student at Princeton University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/">Ryan P. Adams</a>. My research interests are broadly in understanding symmetry and structure in machine learning, and developing theoretically grounded methods for applications in computational physics and materials science. Some research directions I am excited about include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Scalable methods for incorporating symmetry constraints into ML models</li>
                <li>Ways to learn (approximate) symmetries in the data</li>
                <li>ML approaches for scaling density functional theory (DFT) calculations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I did my undergrad at MIT, where I worked on machine learning research with <a href="https://shcen.github.io/">Sarah Cen</a> and <a href="https://devavrat.mit.edu/">Devavrat Shah</a>. I also previously worked on software for Uber ATG, MIT App Inventor, and Divvly.</p>

                    <b>A Single Architecture for Representing Invariance Under Any Space Group</b><br>
                    <b>Cindy Y. Zhang</b>, Elif Ertekin, Peter Orbanz, Ryan P. Adams<br>
                    We construct a single neural architecture that is capable of adapting its weights automatically to enforce invariance to any input space group.<br>

                    <b>Cindy Y. Zhang*</b>, Sarah H. Cen*, Devavrat Shah<br>
                    We present a framework for using singular value thresholding to pre-process sparse, noisy data that improves individual fairness without sacrificing performance.<br>

                    <b>Kirigami Strata: Layers of Symmetry and Form</b><br>
                    This project is part of the European Cultural Centre's architecture exhibition <em>Time Space Existence</em> in Venice, Italy. The tiling pattern for this art piece is one of many possible patterns generated by a flow-based model with enforced symmetries and physical constraints. This pattern is then cut, deployed, and connected from a thin flat steel sheet to form a kirigami space frame with enhanced load-carrying capacity and stiffness.<br>
