Hi! I'm Cindy, a sophomore at MIT studying mathematics and computer science. I am currently working as a software engineer intern at [Divvly](https://divvly.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a startup offering reagent sharing services to researchers.  

I previously worked as an undergraduate researcher at [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/){:target="\_blank"} and a counselor at the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/){:target="\_blank"}. A list of my previous coursework can be found here. 

In my free time, I enjoy running, baking, reading, and taking photos. If you have any questions or would like to chat, free to contact me at cindyyz at mit dot edu.
