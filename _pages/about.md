Hello! I'm a second-year CS PhD student at Princeton University, where I am advised by Professor [Ryan Adams](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/){:target="\_blank"}. I am broadly interested in developing fair and robust machine learning methods that are theoretically motivated.

I did my undergrad at MIT, where I worked on machine learning research with [Sarah Cen](https://shcen.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} and Professor [Devavrat Shah](https://devavrat.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I have also worked on software for Uber ATG, MIT App Inventor, and Divvly.

You can contact me at cindyz at princeton dot edu.
