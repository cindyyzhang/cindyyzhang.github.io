Hi! I'm a senior at MIT studying mathematics and computer science. My main research interests are in understanding and improving machine learning techniques and algorithms in the context of fairness, robustness, and reliability. Currently, I'm working with Professor Devavrat Shah in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.

Previously, I have worked on machine learning research in the [Mądry Lab](http://madry-lab.ml/){:target="\_blank"} and the [Learning and Intelligent Systems Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I have also worked on software for [Uber ATG](https://aurora.tech/){:target="\_blank"}, [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/){:target="\_blank"} and [Divvly](https://divvly.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

If you have any questions or would like to chat, feel free to contact me at cindyyz at mit dot edu.
