Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student at Princeton University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Adji Bousso Dieng](https://vertaix.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. My main research interests are in understanding and improving machine learning algorithms in the context of fairness, robustness, and reliability. My current work focuses on understanding the relationship between diversity in datasets and generalization.

I did my undergrad at MIT, where I worked on machine learning research with [Sarah Cen](https://shcen.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Devavrat Shah](https://devavrat.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I have also worked on software for [Uber ATG](https://aurora.tech/){:target="\_blank"}, [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/){:target="\_blank"} and [Divvly](https://divvly.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

If you have any questions or would like to chat, feel free to contact me at cindyz at princeton dot edu.
