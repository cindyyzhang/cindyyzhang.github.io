Hi! I'm Cindy, a sophomore at MIT studying mathematics and computer science. I previously worked as a software  engineering intern at [Divvly](https://divvly.com/){:target="\_blank"}, an undergraduate researcher at [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/){:target="\_blank"}, and a counselor at the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

Currently, I am interested in using probability and statistics to analyze

In my free time, I enjoy running, baking, and photography. If you have any questions or would like to chat, free to contact me at cindyyz at mit dot edu.
