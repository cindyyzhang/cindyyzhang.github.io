Hi! I'm Cindy, a sophomore at MIT studying mathematics and computer science. My academic interests include machine learning, algorithms, and complexity theory. I'm currently working on research in the [Learning and Intelligent Systems Group](http://lis.csail.mit.edu/new/index.php){:target="\_blank"}.

I previously worked on software for [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/){:target="\_blank"} and [Divvly](https://divvly.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I was also a counselor at the [Ross Mathematics Program](https://rossprogram.org/){:target="\_blank"} and a teaching assistant on [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/){:target="\_blank"}. This upcoming summer, I will be a software engineering intern at [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/){:target="\_blank"}.

In my free time, I enjoy running, cooking, reading, and photography. If you have any questions or would like to chat, feel free to contact me at cindyyz at mit dot edu.
